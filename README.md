📍 U.S. States Game

Welcome to the U.S. States Game! 🎮🗺️
This project is a fun and interactive game built with Python, using the Turtle graphics library and Pandas for data handling.

✨ How to Play

A map of the United States appears.
You'll be asked to guess the names of U.S. states one by one.
When you guess correctly, the state name will appear at the correct location on the map.
If you want to quit anytime, just type "Exit".
When you exit, a file named states_to_learn.csv will be created — listing the states you missed, so you can study them later! 📚
